          My name is Brandon Cortes. I currently work for <a href="https://www.gilbarco.com/us/">Gilbarco</a> as a Tier 2 technical support specialist. I started trying to learn to code becuase it has always seemed interesting to me.
          I believe that there is a posibility for anyone to learn something new and this skill is what I believe is the right choice. I am married with a son on the way which motivates me even more to learn something new and be able to teach him
          that <strong><em>being able to learn is the key to success.</em></strong>
